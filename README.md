My brother and I spend countless hours playing this simple, yet addictive game.
When I learned to code, I wondered if we could automate our experience.
This is the result.


Want to play yourself? Follow these simple steps:

In Terminal:

+ Go to the directory that you want to save the game's root folder in.

+ Copy and paste:

`git clone https://github.com/dfwheeler394/connectFour.git && cd connectFour && open index.html` into your command line

+ Find your brother, your mother, or a friendly stranger on the street and connect four!
